# analyzing_the_met

I decided to do my analysis on the Metropolitan Museum of Art's publicly available dataset - found at https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess/blob/master/MetObjects.csv - I had to download the raw data/csv file and save locally. 

I also wanted to compare the collection at the Cleveland Museum of Art, using the dataset found at their Github page - https://github.com/ClevelandMuseumArt/openaccess/blob/master/data.csv
Another download and save locally.
